          "Everything is not as it seems!" - Abstract Perceptual Quality

          In the pre-phase-0 research for DBC, I had already taken the test to tell me that my learning style was "Abstract Random." In the short time since I had taken the test, I had forgot already. I can probably chalk this up to the workload and new material for DBC in Phase-0 taking over the forefront of my recent memory. So, when it came time to retake the test for this blog entry, I studied the four different learning styles before taking the test and knew then that the outcome would be "Abstract Random." The way it was described as seemed to speak to me directly. 
        </p>
        <p>
          "This quality allows you to visualize, to conceive ideas, to understand or believe that which you cannot actually see. When you are using your abstract quality, you are using your intuition, your imagination, and you are looking beyond “what is” to the more subtle implications. Lets your mind organize information by chunks, and in no particular order. When you are using your random ability, you may often be able to skip steps in a procedure and still produce the desired result. You may even start in the middle, or at the end, and work backwards. You may also prefer your life to be more impulsive, or spur of the moment, than planned."

          My way of thinking and learning is, in my opinion, a handicap when working in Phase-0, but an absolute godsend for Phase-1 and beyond. I learn best by working with others, a staple of the industry I hope to work in. I have never been someone to pore over books and material on my own and be able to fully understand and soak up concepts. My learning style has always been a communal one, be it getting help from others in order to fully visualize a concept, or helping others by showing them instead of telling them. For Phase-0, this is hard for me. The pairs have been an amazing way for me to help cement the concepts we are covering in Phase-0, as there are people who are different thinkers than I and they can help to add a human element to my learning, which helps my style immensely. In order to succeed in the program though, I will have to find a good balance between my learning style and that of a "Concrete Sequential" learner, as it's easy for my type of learning style to fall behind as a result of my way of thinking. However, I feel that as far as the development industry is concerned, my way of thinking is a more beneficial one as it lends to more innovation and creativity, as opposed to a "thinking inside the box" style that goes along with "Concrete Sequential" more. To understand the different styles better, here is a chart of the 4 styles.

          Part of my thinking style, however, lends itself to a Fixed Mindset. To get a good idea of the diference between a fixed and growth mindset, refer to this picture:

          Most of this stems from some sense of self-doubt that all thinking styles lend themselves to, in one way or another. In order to maximize my learning potential and reap as much as possible from DBC, I have to do my best to make my mindset more of a Growth Mindset. Failure and success do not hinge on minutia, and both cannot be achieved after one problem. It's more of a "big picture" way of thinking and respecting yourself. Knowing that everything you do, be it an achievement or a pitfall, does not dictate one's abilities or future in a selected field. Success is something that comes from within, as opposed to something earned. These are all fine and dandy to say, but it really requires a strong will to change the way you deem success and failure and the lessons you learn from both. I know that I have to both change my way of studying and learning, as well as change the way I view myself after successes and failures, in order to achieve a Growth Mindset. However, I truly believe that a greater sense of self-worth and happiness comes to those who do.
