          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome"/>
          "The impostor syndrome is a psychological phenomenon in which people are unable to internalize their accomplishments. Despite external evidence of their competence, those with the syndrome remain convinced that they are frauds and do not deserve the success they have achieved. Proof of success is dismissed as luck, timing, or as a result of deceiving others into thinking they are more intelligent and competent than they believe themselves to be.""

          This one hit home pretty hard for me. I feel like I've consistently identified with a lot of the feelings of "Imposter Syndrome" throughout my schooling and professional career. I've had moments of extreme confidence and a strong belief in my abilities and intellectual prowess, but I've also always struggled with other's perceptions of me when it comes to academics. I'm a college graduate. I've created critically acclaimed pieces of work in my career. Yet, I've always had the nagging feeling that I'm just making up for my shortcomings with charisma. I'm a bit of a perfectionist, and since that's so rarely attained in anything, I'm never %100 satisfied with my work. This is not due to lack of effort or apathy, but more to a hyper-critical view of my own worth and an over-inflated view of others. While I may struggle with a concept or a project, I never assume others do so. My studying and learning on my own won't allow me to see other people in their moments of frustration and vulnerability, and so I assume it must come easy to everyone but me.

          A good example of this would be the BINGO challenges in the last two weeks. I can't even begin to explain how hard these were for me. Not because of the actual knowledge of methods necessary to find the answer, but because of the steps necessary in actually creating a BINGO game. For some reason, my brain was not mapping out the steps in the correct order and I was getting increasingly frustrated and down on myself. This was in stark contrast to the credit card challenge that I did with relative ease, at least in comparison with the BINGO challenge, as I could follow the steps of the algorithm provided. When I saw other people had finished the BINGO challenges earlier in the week than me, I assumed it was due to some sort of ease on their part, as opposed to them struggling with it as much as I had. Once I had a chance to talk with some of my fellow cohort-mates, I realized that a great deal of them went through the same struggles I did, only their schedulas allowed them to jump right into the challenges on Monday. Since I ended up having to work more hours than I expected these past few weeks, coupled with the fact that I have two small children, I realized that my schedule was really what dictated my doubt. I had been forced to do the curriculum on a shorter week than some, and had subconciously convinced myself that others finishing before me had to do with my own failure to grasp the material instead of my higher level of outside responsibilities than most. I still have a lot more studying and practice to do in order to feel more comfortable with the material up to this point, but so do many of my classmates as we all are having to deal with the accelerated learning structure.

          I think in Phase-1, when I have planned to be able to put my life on hold, I'll be a bit more comfortable with my knowledge and abilities, as well as what I have to offer to my cohort. My beautiful wife, on the other hand, is going to have her work cut out for her. (Sorry, Sarah. It'll be worth it, I swear! Thank God for doting Grandparents...)
