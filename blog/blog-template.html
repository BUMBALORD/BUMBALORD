  <h1>Chef's in the Kitchen</h1>
  <h2>Never Too Many Cooks</h2>
  <h4>Jan 12th, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
        Having just watched Shereef's video, Kitchen vs Table, I can say that I'm feeling more confident than ever in both myself, and in the program I've chosen to dedicate months of my life, and probably all spare time therein, to. This isn't to say that I feel like I'm up to par, coding skills wise, or even understand what the physical and emotional strains are going to be, as I know I won't be able to comprehend those until the loooooong days start. But what I do feel confident in hearing, is that we're all just still part of the same initial experiment that Shereef began when he wanted to teach his friend Ruby. There's something incredibly comforting in knowing that the team atmosphere is king, and no one who chooses not to, will be left behind. I may not be a head chef yet, but I've got a nice knife and I'm ready to work the line with others like me.
    </p>
    <p>
        I think that the culture that DBC attempts to convey is a very good fit for me. I can't say now how it will be to acclimate to it, as it's still something that I think everyone will have to experience and come to grips with on their own, but I can say that I'm very impressed by how Shereef can make such a hard and challenging experience seem so inviting. Despite me knowing that there are hard times and exhausting hours ahead, I really can honestly say that I can't wait to keep learning and begin the process. Having just finished the first week of Phase 0, all I can think about is learning more and keeping this going. I'm having a great time doing this by myself and I'm really excited to be able to do it with others soon.
    </p>
    <p>
        Shereef also touched on something that really took away a lot of my concerns in the video. When he talked about the 2 fears that people have going into the program, he hit the nail on the head for me. I definitely belong to the former, in that I've seen some other student's work and they clearly have a bit more experience than I do. Until watching, there's been that underlying fear of being behind or slow that I know is silly, but still eats at me. Hearing Shereef say that parity is much closer than any of us thinks is very good to hear. The first week of Phase 0 has also done a good job alleviating concerns for me. Before Monday, I'd never punched anything into my command line that wasn't copy/pasted off an internet page. Now, I've got two blog entries on a site that I made myself entirely through my Terminal and Sublime Text. It might not be a lot to someone who's experienced, but to me, it's huge.

        I can't wait to learn more!

    <!-- Git and Version Control Entry -->

  <h1>Intro to Git</h1>
  <h2>I'ma GIT you suckah!</h2>
  <h4>Jan 11th, 2015</h4>

    <p>
      As someone completely new to the world of programming, simply being able to create this blog post through the command line is an incredibly rewarding and encouraging experience. I couldn't have possibly imagined how to achieve this feat even days ago, and now thanks to a lot of repitition, it's starting to become a little bit second nature. (At least for the simple stuff!)
    </p>
    <p>
        Part of what makes me much less intimidated to just dive right into coding is version control. For those who have yet to hear the term, the analogy that helped me wrap my head around the concept of version control was likening it to a save state in a video game. In the same way how we can venture forth and fight space marines or slay dragons without fear of complete failure once we've saved our favorite game, version control allows us to freeze our code in time and then tinker with it to our heart's content without fear of fubar-ing everything we worked so hard to get to. If we fail at adding to or strengthening our code, much in the same way we may fail and be eaten by said dragon in a game, we can always just jump right back in time to the state of code we had before we ever changed one line. As someone just beginning to get their feet wet in the vast ocean of programming, version control is my lifevest as I attempt to backstroke my way into coding competence.
    </p>
    <p>
        Git is the means to that version control. By installing git, and the accompanying Github, I can choose exactly how I want to proceed when dealing with any programming challenge. I can make a single change or multiple changes and keep track of all of them through my command line, ensuring that nothing gets commited or pushed until it's ready to be. I have the ability, through git, to be well organized and prepared for any challenge that may come my way. 
    </p>
    <p>
        While git is stored locally on my computer and allows me to use all of it's features through the command line, Github is it's remote counterpart that lives within the internet. Github not only allows me a space to visually see all of my work I push to the site, but it allows a level of collaboration on code that makes it an invaluable tool for any programmer or company. Github essentially lets as many people as you want work on the same piece of code without fear of fragmenting it and breaking it. Thanks to version control, and a thing called branches, programmers can work simultaneously on the same code without having to worry about what the next person is changing in said code. Think of Github like the trunk of a tree. Our saved state of working code is the trunk, and every person or group that wishes to work on it can start a new branch. If the branch works, it is absorbed into the tree trunk to grow larger, and if it doesn't, then we can alway snap that branch off and start again. Github also allows us to get other's feedback or help by requesting a "pull" on Github. This essentially is just a notice for other developers to assess and okay your code before it is added to the trunk of the tree. This allows for not only a high level of collaboration, but an immense level of quality control that can benefit everyone involved.
