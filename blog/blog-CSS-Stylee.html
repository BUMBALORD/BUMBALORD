          Margin, Border and Padding are the three elements that surround any piece of content that we wish. The Border is the edge of our element. Simply put, it is a border around whatever we want similar to a picture frame around a photo. Padding is the space between our content and our border if we wish to have a space there. Margin is the transparent area surrounding our border. This can be used to create space for the border and content therein, so it doesn;t have to be flush against any other element, for example. The following picture will illustrate the differences between the 3:

          Classes and ID's are simply a way for us to add CSS styling to different elements in our code. Classes are a way for us to group multiple elements inside of one class and then give styling information to all of the elements in that class at once. Think of it as a way to write one piece of code to affect multiple elements instead of having to write it out for each individual one. For instance, if we wanted to turn a bunch of different paragraphs blue, we would put them into a class together and we could do it in one piece of code in the CSS stylesheet.
          For instance: In HTML, div class="blog" would afffect any elements contained inside of the div. We would affect them in CSS with .blog

          <br>

          ID's are similar to classes, only they affect one single element and opposed to many at once. They look similar to classes, only they are referred to in CSS with a # sign.
          For example: div ID="blog" would effect only that element. In CSS, we would refer to it with #blog
          <br>

          Fixed positioning is used to anchor an element down. For instance, if we had a sidebar that we never wanted to leave the page, even while scrolling, we would declare it fixed. It essentially "glues" in down to the page. Absolute positioning is similar, in that it can be anchored to a place in the page, like a header, only we can scroll past it on a page. It will always be at the top of the page, but we can scroll past it down the page and it will leave our view. It is still at the top of the page, but it is not always in sight like fixed positioning is. Relative positioning means that the element will move relative to where it would have defaulted to as static. This can be helpful in keeping elements seperated from each other, but still aware of the space that the other elements take up, keeping our page from having overlapping elements.

          Inline display is a way of displaying elements in a horizontal fashion while giving the element as much width as it needs to sit on the same line. It is best suited for things like headers and paragraphs, as the elements contained therein don't need additional information on how to relate to each other. Margin and padding won't have an effect on the elements contained inside. Inline-Block display is similar to inline, in that it is a way of horizontally displaying our elements, only it allows each element to sit inside it's own "block." It does not give the elements the full width, but additional information can be given to the elements to make sure they are displayed correctly. For instance, a horizontal line of links would be best to use inline-block for, as we can then dictate the amount of space in between each link, as opposed to them sitting flush with each other like inline would produce.
