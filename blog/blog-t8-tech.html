         We have primarily been focusing on the language Ruby so far in Phase-0 of DevBootcamp. Ruby is an Object Oriented Programming language that is quite popular today and is used primarily in web programming. As someone new to the language, I had heard of Ruby on Rails before, but had no actual knowledge of what it was and how it differed from Ruby. I did a bit of research into it and have learned more about what Ruby on Rails is and how it is different from it's bigger brother, Ruby. 
        </p>
        <p>
         Ruby on Rails, or simply Rails, is essentially a software library that extends the abilities and possibilities of Ruby. It is specifically a "RubyGem" that is installed through the command line and serves the purpose of giving Ruby a framework for building websites. Rails incorporates the traditional Ruby with HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create web applications. These web applications run on a web server, so Rails is traditionally a "back-end" development platform.
        </p>
        <p>
         Part of the allure of Rails is the community that uses it and provides comprehensive documentation for it's use. It's large userbase provides a countless amount of software libraries that allow Rails users to build very complex websites much easier. The community shares tools and documentation freely so that users can share their work or use other's work in the means of furthering the language and building web applications in a more timely and less complex manner. 
        </p>  
        <p>
         Software libraries that are shared with Ruby and Rails are generally referred to as "Gems." These Gems can be installed by any user and provide depth to the language. Ruby was chosen as the language for Rails as a result of these Gems being easy to access and install, as well as Ruby's general ease of use and uncluttered way of programming. Since Rails must stick to a specific structure when creating web applications, Ruby fits the bill as it is an easy to read language. Rails applications, like I said before,  stick to a specific structure so they may be easily understood by other developers in order to maximize collaboration. In other words, one Rails dev should be able to immediately understand another dev's program upon looking at the code. Essentially, Rails is just a set of files that is organized in a specific way. This way to be exact:
        </p>  
        <p align=center> 
        <img src="http://i.imgur.com/5oEHSRQ.jpg" style="width:662px;height:278px">
        </p>
        <p>
         These are all folders, or folders within folders, that make up the file structure universally accepted by Rails. While some of these folders may not even be used by some web applications, in the means of uniformity, they must all be present in a Rails developed program. Some are easy to understand, such as where our images and stylesheets are kept, and some are completely foreign to someone like me at this time.
        </p>  
        <p>
         Rails is not without its criticisms as well. though. Ruby as a language is not as fast as Java or C, although that is generally not an issue in web application development, as it is plenty fast enough more almost every applicable use. The other gripe that some developers have with Rails is it's ease of use through the Gems. Since the community provides many assets to the developers for building, a lot of people feel that it allows Rails Devs to build complex sites using software libraries that they may not fully understand. In other words, a few lines of code may provide us in Rails what would take 100 lines in another language, so there will always be those who excel at Rails, yet fail to comprehend what they are fully and completely doing at the same time. They may know how to get it done, but they may not know why it works. All of these criticisms have their merit, but the one thing that cannot be denied of Rails is it's ability to allow developers to create increasingly complex web applications in a much less complicated and overbearing way. It's open community and freely accessible tools are what sets it aside from the competition.
