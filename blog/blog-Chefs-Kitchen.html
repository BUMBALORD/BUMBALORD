        Having just watched Shereef's video, Kitchen vs Table, I can say that I'm feeling more confident than ever in both myself, and in the program I've chosen to dedicate months of my life, and probably all spare time therein, to. This isn't to say that I feel like I'm up to par, coding skills wise, or even understand what the physical and emotional strains are going to be, as I know I won't be able to comprehend those until the loooooong days start. But what I do feel confident in hearing, is that we're all just still part of the same initial experiment that Shereef began when he wanted to teach his friend Ruby. There's something incredibly comforting in knowing that the team atmosphere is king, and no one who chooses not to, will be left behind. I may not be a head chef yet, but I've got a nice knife and I'm ready to work the line with others like me.

        I think that the culture that DBC attempts to convey is a very good fit for me. I can't say now how it will be to acclimate to it, as it's still something that I think everyone will have to experience and come to grips with on their own, but I can say that I'm very impressed by how Shereef can make such a hard and challenging experience seem so inviting. Despite me knowing that there are hard times and exhausting hours ahead, I really can honestly say that I can't wait to keep learning and begin the process. Having just finished the first week of Phase 0, all I can think about is learning more and keeping this going. I'm having a great time doing this by myself and I'm really excited to be able to do it with others soon.

        Shereef also touched on something that really took away a lot of my concerns in the video. When he talked about the 2 fears that people have going into the program, he hit the nail on the head for me. I definitely belong to the former, in that I've seen some other student's work and they clearly have a bit more experience than I do. Until watching, there's been that underlying fear of being behind or slow that I know is silly, but still eats at me. Hearing Shereef say that parity is much closer than any of us thinks is very good to hear. The first week of Phase 0 has also done a good job alleviating concerns for me. Before Monday, I'd never punched anything into my command line that wasn't copy/pasted off an internet page. Now, I've got two blog entries on a site that I made myself entirely through my Terminal and Sublime Text. It might not be a lot to someone who's experienced, but to me, it's huge.

        I can't wait to learn more!
