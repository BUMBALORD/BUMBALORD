        <p>
      As someone completely new to the world of programming, simply being able to create this blog post through the command line is an incredibly rewarding and encouraging experience. I couldn't have possibly imagined how to achieve this feat even days ago, and now thanks to a lot of repitition, it's starting to become a little bit second nature. (At least for the simple stuff!)
    </p>
    <p>
        Part of what makes me much less intimidated to just dive right into coding is version control. For those who have yet to hear the term, the analogy that helped me wrap my head around the concept of version control was likening it to a save state in a video game. In the same way how we can venture forth and fight space marines or slay dragons without fear of complete failure once we've saved our favorite game, version control allows us to freeze our code in time and then tinker with it to our heart's content without fear of fubar-ing everything we worked so hard to get to. If we fail at adding to or strengthening our code, much in the same way we may fail and be eaten by said dragon in a game, we can always just jump right back in time to the state of code we had before we ever changed one line. As someone just beginning to get their feet wet in the vast ocean of programming, version control is my lifevest as I attempt to backstroke my way into coding competence.
    </p>
    <p>
        Git is the means to that version control. By installing git, and the accompanying Github, I can choose exactly how I want to proceed when dealing with any programming challenge. I can make a single change or multiple changes and keep track of all of them through my command line, ensuring that nothing gets commited or pushed until it's ready to be. I have the ability, through git, to be well organized and prepared for any challenge that may come my way. 
    </p>
    <p>
        While git is stored locally on my computer and allows me to use all of it's features through the command line, Github is it's remote counterpart that lives within the internet. Github not only allows me a space to visually see all of my work I push to the site, but it allows a level of collaboration on code that makes it an invaluable tool for any programmer or company. Github essentially lets as many people as you want work on the same piece of code without fear of fragmenting it and breaking it. Thanks to version control, and a thing called branches, programmers can work simultaneously on the same code without having to worry about what the next person is changing in said code. Think of Github like the trunk of a tree. Our saved state of working code is the trunk, and every person or group that wishes to work on it can start a new branch. If the branch works, it is absorbed into the tree trunk to grow larger, and if it doesn't, then we can alway snap that branch off and start again. Github also allows us to get other's feedback or help by requesting a "pull" on Github. This essentially is just a notice for other developers to assess and okay your code before it is added to the trunk of the tree. This allows for not only a high level of collaboration, but an immense level of quality control that can benefit everyone involved.
