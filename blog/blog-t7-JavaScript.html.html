         We are now almost a week into learning JavaScript and, while we are just scratching the surface, it is easy to see the similarities between JavaScript and Ruby, which we have worked on for over a month now. They are very similar in look, with most of the differences being in subtle syntax and keyword changes between the two. There are very simple ones, such as == in Ruby and === in JavaScript, and more complex ones such as declaring functions vs methods. One of the very similar traits of the two is Hashes in Ruby and Objects in JavaScript. Essentially, they are both a way to organize key/value pairs in the two languages. For instance, let's say we wanted to create a way to organize our favorite characters from the Simpsons. If we wanted to create an object in JavaScript, we would declare it as a variable and include our information like so: 
        </p>
        <p align=center> 
        <img src="http://i.imgur.com/pnJUxas.jpg" style="width:564px;height:76px">
        </p>
        <p>
          To access any of our information contained inside the object, we simply call on it like so:
        </p>  
        <p align=center> 
        <img src="http://i.imgur.com/8po8p0S.jpg" style="width:377px;height:52px">
        </p>
        <p>
          If we wanted to add any data to the object we could simply write it out as so:
        </p>  
        <p align=center> 
        <img src="http://i.imgur.com/B4K34To.jpg" style="width:178px;height:52px">
        </p>
        <p>
          This would add these "drink" key/value pairs to the end of our objects and allow us to access them later through the means outlined above.
        </p>  
        <br>
        <p>
          In Ruby, we store data like this inside of a Hash, which looks similar to an object in JavaScript, but has different syntax and keywords for declaring it. Let's create a menu for Moe's Tavern with a Hash in Ruby. We would write it out like so:
        </p>
        <p align=center> 
        <img src="http://i.imgur.com/3rm7hNF.jpg" style="width:286px;height:99px">
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to retrieve information from the Hash, we would access it like so:
        </p>
        <p align=center> 
        <img src="http://i.imgur.com/kW6XZMc.jpg" style="width:306px;height:58px">
        </p>
        <p>
          If we wanted to add any key/value pairs to our hash, we would write:
        </p>
        <p align=center> 
        <img src="http://i.imgur.com/TmrINVM.jpg" style="width:344px;height:54px">
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          As you can see, the two are very similar in what they are capable of doing within the language. The only real difference, besides syntax, is what is accessible within our program and at what point. Ruby is a class based language and JavaScript is not, so they have fundamental differences in what is accessible at any given point in the scope of our program. However, if both of our examples above are to be treated as accessible, then the similarities are impossible to miss.
