         My priorities might be a bit different from many in my cohort, as at this point in my life having a family is my most important value. I'm married with two young boys, and happier than I've ever been in my life as a result. Until I understood what it was to be a husband and a father, most of my values were self-centered, albeit for (mostly)virtuous reasons. Now, my driving force is to make my family happy, comfortable and proud above all else. My individual accomplishments and drive for success help to accomplish this value, but without them I wouldn't have the perspective of what matters most to me in life. It's hard to imagine my life without them at this point. I want nothing more than for my values and ideals to make them proud and help to put us in a better place financially and mentally. It's easy to lose sight of the things that matter the most when you are a young man trying to make your way in the world, but they are both the drive and the will that pushes me everyday to accomplish my personal goals as we all benefit from them.

          Much of the advice these days that I get asked for is directly relatable to the above. Since I'm in my early 30's, I'm at the point in my life where many of my friends and peers are making the decision to marry or have children. I'm finding that less of the advice I'm asked for is occupational, and more domestic. I think this is probably a direct result of my friends and family seeing that my wife and I have made it work with 2 young children in the face of the stress and challenges that come with them. That's not to say that it is easy. It is always hard. Life is constantly challenging you, in both your personal and work life, but the ability to keep a cool head and stay collected is probably the most important thing you can do. No one becomes anything, especially a parent, knowing everything there is to know. Every single day is a learning experience and a crossroads that force you to really weigh your ideals and priorities. At the end of the day, for me at least, my family comes first when it comes to everything. My family, however, knows that my personal accomplishments and strive for achievement and knowledge are a benefit to us all. If one of us succeeds, we all do.
