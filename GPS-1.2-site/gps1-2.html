        <h2> What is Pair Programming? </h2>
        <p> Pair programming refers to when 2 programmers work together to build a code based project             . It entails one person serving as the role of a driver, and the other as the navigator.             Pair programming is important because it helps minimize human error and maximize human               creativity.

        <h2> Why is Pair Programming important to DBC? </h2>
        <p>  Pair programming to core to DBC's curriculum for several reasons. The first reason is                that it helps reiterate previously learned concepts. Secondly, it gives 2 people a                   chance to practice vocalizing their ideas on building a code based project together.                 Lastly, it simulates the industry standard of building code based project as a team.
        
        </p> 
        
        <h2> What is the difference between Driver and Navigator? </h2>
        <p>  The Navigator is the brain and the Driver is the hands. They both work together                      collaboratively. Usually, they switch roles throughout the project in order to both see              the project from each perspective.

    <!-- This was a fun pairing session for me. I worked with Tina Patel, and besides getting off to a bit off a rocky Driver/Navigator relationship due to us both contributing at the same time, I thought we worked really well together. We slipped into the conventional roles quickly, and it was a really easy and fun experience working with her. It's funny, because I think I tend to have a bit of self doubt before these GPS sessions, in the way that I feel I might not be as good as my partner, but during both sessions I've experienced, that hasn't been the case. I've had knowledge to help my partner and vice versa. I think I did really well in showing my competency for the material, while still agknowledging that it's all so new to me that I'm really a beginner. It was a great pairing session!
