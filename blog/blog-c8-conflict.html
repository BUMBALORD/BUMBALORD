         Conflict is inevitable. It will materialize at the most inopportune times and catch you completely off guard, or it will slowly start and grow over time, festering until it reaches it's breaking point. Many people tend to try to avoid conflict at any cost, making them entirely unprepared for a healthy resolve when it does inevitably rear it's ugly head. I have had more than enough experience with conflict in my life, and now at 32 years old, I am finally settling into a comfortable space in terms of how I go about dealing with it.

          In my extended family, conflict is king. I can't actually remember a time when everyone was talking and friendly with each other. There has, as far as my memory goes back, always been at the very least a handful of people mad at a handful of other people within my greater family. I come from a very large family with well over 50 members, and my father and uncles were raised to thrive on conflict. They were pitted against each other for the love of my grandparents, and this dichotomy shaped them into the people that they are today. Winning an argument with your fists was just as good as winning with your words, if not better. This, obviously, carried on well into their adulthood, and would be passed down to many of my generation as well.

          While I would rather not get into the specifics of any particular case, I have a lot of experience with conflict among my immediate family members, namely my brothers and I. There are 4 of us, and we all come from different mothers, so resentment has become quite a source of conflict over the years. I have had stretches of time, in the past, as long as a year or more where I have gone without speaking to one or more of my siblings. When I was younger, I felt that my ideals and honor were at risk by being the bigger person and putting things behind me, as many young people do. While I may have felt that I was completely in the right during many of these conflicts, I have come to learn that the way I had dealt with them in the past was wrong and led to more resentment and anger.

          After years and years of the same old story when it came to family conlict, I resolved to not get myself trapped in the negative feelings and overall toxicity of these fights. Perhaps it was becoming a father and realizing how much it would break my heart to see my sons go through the same thing, or maybe it was just something that I learned through enough experience in the horrible feelings it brought about, but now I actively aim to defuse and seal with conflict as it arises, instead of letting it fester and grow. I find myself to be a much happier person when I don't have the vitriol of conflict seaping through my bloodstream. It took me a long time to realize that the self-satisfaction of "winning" any conflict pales in comparison to the happiness achieved by actively avoiding it entirely or dealing with it like a rational adult. It's hard to break the loop (programming joke) of normalcy, if conlict is normal, even when it proves to detrimental at every instance of it. I'm still working very hard at being more at peace with myself and the people around me, but at the end of the day, I am a much happier person without the black cloud of conflict hovering over my head.
