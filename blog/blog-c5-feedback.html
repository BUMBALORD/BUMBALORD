          In Phase-0 of the Dev Bootcamp program, we pair on coding challenges, both manditorily and electively each week. At first, this seems a bit daunting because we naturally compare ourselves and our learning styles to that of others. As someone who came into the program completely green to the world of coding, I initially worried that these sessions would possibly prove my lack of ability or perhaps showcase other's pre-learned talents that would cement how behind I was in the curriculum. I'm quite happy to say that these feelings dissipated the very minute my first peering session began. What I learned, from the first few times I paired, was that everyone in this program came in with different levels of skill and that no two people are going to be completely equal when it comes to a knowledge of code and programming. What I also learned, is that pairing sessions are far more about the ability to compassionately and constructively work with another human being on code than they are about stressing any given person's abilities at that time.

          I've had peer pairing sessions where I have had to drive for more of the challenge, as my partner was better with the material, and I've had sessions where I came up with most of the code necessary to complete the challenge. Both of these scenarios have proved incredibly helpful for my learning the material and for my ability to work with others in a helpful way. The main thing I've always done in sessions is make sure that we are vocal about our thoughts. No matter what side of the spectrum you fall into during pairing sessions, everyone benefits from an open discourse. It can help the navigator find their thoughts, and it can allow the driver to understand the material better as they transpose the navigator's ideas. Both the fun and the difficulties of pairing are one and the same. Since we work together as a unit, we experience the highs of problem solving and lows of hitting roadblocks together. This, in and of itself, is entirely the point of the process.

          Feedback is also a scary notion. We learn at the beginning of the program that we should always be "Actionable," "Specific," and "Kind," but the idea of being judged or graded is never something that people inherently enjoy. (Apologies to you crazy people that actually do.) So, prior to reading any of my feedback I was a bit nervous to see how other people would evaluate me. This too turned out to be a silly fear. Every piece of feedback I've recieved has been very nice and encouraging, as well as helpful in evaluating my own self. I haven't had any issues with any of the "Actionable" feedback I've got and people have been very good about being "Kind." I think my pushing to be vocal in the sessions has paid off, as I've recieved very nice words from people supporting that style of pairing. I know it helps me, and I'm glad it does to others as well. The most difficult part for me so far has been finding ways to be "Actionable" with many of my pairs, as they've all been really good, easy to work with, people. There's always something to come up with, especially if I have to nit pick, but I have yet to have a bad pairing partner so that may be the reason. I think the program really breeds a kind of mutual respect between peers, and it's pretty apparent for me so far with the people I've met and worked with.
