          Margin, Border and Padding are the three elements that surround any piece of content that we wish. The Border is the edge of our element. Simply put, it is a border around whatever we want similar to a picture frame around a photo. Padding is the space between our content and our border if we wish to have a space there. Margin is the transparent area surrounding our border. This can be used to create space for the border and content therein, so it doesn;t have to be flush against any other element, for example. The following picture will illustrate the differences between the 3:

          Classes and ID's are simply a way for us to add CSS styling to different elements in our code. Classes are a way for us to group multiple elements inside of one class and then give styling information to all of the elements in that class at once. Think of it as a way to write one piece of code to affect multiple elements instead of having to write it out for each individual one. For instance, if we wanted to turn a bunch of different paragraphs blue, we would put them into a class together and we could do it in one piece of code in the CSS stylesheet.
          For instance: In HTML, div class="blog" would afffect any elements contained inside of the div. We would affect them in CSS with .blog

          <br> 
          <br>
          ID's are similar to classes, only they affect one single element and opposed to many at once. They look similar to classes, only they are referred to in CSS with a # sign.
          For example: div ID="blog" would effect only that element. In CSS, we would refer to it with #blog
          <br>  
          <br>
          Fixed positioning is used to anchor an element down. For instance, if we had a sidebar that we never wanted to leave the page, even while scrolling, we would declare it fixed. It essentially "glues" in down to the page. Absolute positioning is similar, in that it can be anchored to a place in the page, like a header, only we can scroll past it on a page. It will always be at the top of the page, but we can scroll past it down the page and it will leave our view. It is still at the top of the page, but it is not always in sight like fixed positioning is. Relative positioning means that the element will move relative to where it would have defaulted to as static. This can be helpful in keeping elements seperated from each other, but still aware of the space that the other elements take up, keeping our page from having overlapping elements.
          <br>
          <br>
          Inline display is a way of displaying elements in a horizontal fashion while giving the element as much width as it needs to sit on the same line. It is best suited for things like headers and paragraphs, as the elements contained therein don't need additional information on how to relate to each other. Margin and padding won't have an effect on the elements contained inside. Inline-Block display is similar to inline, in that it is a way of horizontally displaying our elements, only it allows each element to sit inside it's own "block." It does not give the elements the full width, but additional information can be given to the elements to make sure they are displayed correctly. For instance, a horizontal line of links would be best to use inline-block for, as we can then dictate the amount of space in between each link, as opposed to them sitting flush with each other like inline would produce.

        Having just watched Shereef's video, Kitchen vs Table, I can say that I'm feeling more confident than ever in both myself, and in the program I've chosen to dedicate months of my life, and probably all spare time therein, to. This isn't to say that I feel like I'm up to par, coding skills wise, or even understand what the physical and emotional strains are going to be, as I know I won't be able to comprehend those until the loooooong days start. But what I do feel confident in hearing, is that we're all just still part of the same initial experiment that Shereef began when he wanted to teach his friend Ruby. There's something incredibly comforting in knowing that the team atmosphere is king, and no one who chooses not to, will be left behind. I may not be a head chef yet, but I've got a nice knife and I'm ready to work the line with others like me.
    </p>
    <p>
        I think that the culture that DBC attempts to convey is a very good fit for me. I can't say now how it will be to acclimate to it, as it's still something that I think everyone will have to experience and come to grips with on their own, but I can say that I'm very impressed by how Shereef can make such a hard and challenging experience seem so inviting. Despite me knowing that there are hard times and exhausting hours ahead, I really can honestly say that I can't wait to keep learning and begin the process. Having just finished the first week of Phase 0, all I can think about is learning more and keeping this going. I'm having a great time doing this by myself and I'm really excited to be able to do it with others soon.
    </p>
    <p>
        Shereef also touched on something that really took away a lot of my concerns in the video. When he talked about the 2 fears that people have going into the program, he hit the nail on the head for me. I definitely belong to the former, in that I've seen some other student's work and they clearly have a bit more experience than I do. Until watching, there's been that underlying fear of being behind or slow that I know is silly, but still eats at me. Hearing Shereef say that parity is much closer than any of us thinks is very good to hear. The first week of Phase 0 has also done a good job alleviating concerns for me. Before Monday, I'd never punched anything into my command line that wasn't copy/pasted off an internet page. Now, I've got two blog entries on a site that I made myself entirely through my Terminal and Sublime Text. It might not be a lot to someone who's experienced, but to me, it's huge.

        I can't wait to learn more!

      As someone completely new to the world of programming, simply being able to create this blog post through the command line is an incredibly rewarding and encouraging experience. I couldn't have possibly imagined how to achieve this feat even days ago, and now thanks to a lot of repitition, it's starting to become a little bit second nature. (At least for the simple stuff!)
    </p>

        Part of what makes me much less intimidated to just dive right into coding is version control. For those who have yet to hear the term, the analogy that helped me wrap my head around the concept of version control was likening it to a save state in a video game. In the same way how we can venture forth and fight space marines or slay dragons without fear of complete failure once we've saved our favorite game, version control allows us to freeze our code in time and then tinker with it to our heart's content without fear of fubar-ing everything we worked so hard to get to. If we fail at adding to or strengthening our code, much in the same way we may fail and be eaten by said dragon in a game, we can always just jump right back in time to the state of code we had before we ever changed one line. As someone just beginning to get their feet wet in the vast ocean of programming, version control is my lifevest as I attempt to backstroke my way into coding competence.
    </p>
    <p>
        Git is the means to that version control. By installing git, and the accompanying Github, I can choose exactly how I want to proceed when dealing with any programming challenge. I can make a single change or multiple changes and keep track of all of them through my command line, ensuring that nothing gets commited or pushed until it's ready to be. I have the ability, through git, to be well organized and prepared for any challenge that may come my way. 
    </p>
    <p>
        While git is stored locally on my computer and allows me to use all of it's features through the command line, Github is it's remote counterpart that lives within the internet. Github not only allows me a space to visually see all of my work I push to the site, but it allows a level of collaboration on code that makes it an invaluable tool for any programmer or company. Github essentially lets as many people as you want work on the same piece of code without fear of fragmenting it and breaking it. Thanks to version control, and a thing called branches, programmers can work simultaneously on the same code without having to worry about what the next person is changing in said code. Think of Github like the trunk of a tree. Our saved state of working code is the trunk, and every person or group that wishes to work on it can start a new branch. If the branch works, it is absorbed into the tree trunk to grow larger, and if it doesn't, then we can alway snap that branch off and start again. Github also allows us to get other's feedback or help by requesting a "pull" on Github. This essentially is just a notice for other developers to assess and okay your code before it is added to the trunk of the tree. This allows for not only a high level of collaboration, but an immense level of quality control that can benefit everyone involved.
