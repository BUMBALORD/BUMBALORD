          Object oriented programming and functional programming are considered, by some, to be opposites. This is primarily because of the way they are written. There are many different voices with many different opinions when it comes to the benefits of one versus the other. However, the same tasks can be accomplished in either language style and it seems to really come down to the preference of the coder themselves. 
        </p>
        <p>
          So far in the program, we have been working primarily in Ruby. Ruby is an example of Object Oriented Programming. It is generally written with the scope of the entire program in mind when starting the code and plotting out it's different classes and methods. OOP generally follows a set guideline for the class structures and methods contained therein, and it's benefit is mainly in that it can clearly convey what parts of the program are communicating with other parts. Programs that are written once and have no need for updates in the future are much more likely to be written in OOP. The main negative generally associated with OOP is that small changes and additions to the code are harder to implement as more of the code must be updated to accomodate the newly added code.
        </p>  
        <p>
          Functional programming is written in almost the opposite fashion. Smaller parts of the code are written independently of each other and aren't generally written to be able to communicate with each other over the scope of the whole program. In the case of Ruby, we might write a class with several methods that can all harness the same inputs throughout the code, or push data to pre-written mathods by simply updating our already existing code. In a functional language, we would probably write each part of the code as a seperate and fully functional piece. If updates are needed in the future, much less of the existing code needs to be updated to work with our additions, as they are generally self-contained already. We would add code to our program, instead of rewriting what we already had in place like we would with OOP more often. Functional programming is generally regarded as being beneficial to programs that must be consistently updated and added to.

          The benefits of both programming styles of languages seems to come down to personal preference more than anything. While people who work in one may decry the other as less productive, productivity in coding comes down to the thinking style of the programmer themselves. OOP is a bit more useful for those who can think in the "big picture" about their program, while functional programming is probably better for people that like to build and add to their code as they go. One may be more productive for one type of thinker, while another person may thrive with the other style simply as a result of how their brain maps out the means to complete the program. Since I really only have experience in one of the two, it's unwise for me to crown one the victor, but I can definitely see the benefits and negatives to both. This is not to say that it's "one or the other," as many examples of well written code will have concepts from both OOP and Functional programming contained within them.
