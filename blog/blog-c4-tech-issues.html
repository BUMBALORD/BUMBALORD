               What are we, as programmers, going to be forced into in the coming years?

          In the wake of a series of cyber attacks that occured in the last year, the controversial bill "CISPA" (or Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act) has reemerged after being shot down by the Senate last year. The only difference this time, however, is that the White House has come out in favor of the Act, as opposed to it's anti-CISPA stance that it maintained prior the bill's first demise. While there have been a wave of cyber-attacks on some very high profile victims in the last year, namely Sony Pictures with "The Interview" or the rash of different celebrities who had revealing pictures stolen from their iCloud service, the general public stands to sacrifice an incredible amount of their online privacy if the bill finally passes. We, as programmers in training, are then placed into a very precarious position by entering into an industry that might undergo such drastic changes soon.

          If passed, "the bill encourages the private sector to share appropriate cyber threat information with the Dept. of Homeland Security, which will then share it with other U.S. government agencies and private sector companies," says the Obama Administration. In a few short words, this means that in a similar vein to the Patriot Act and the NSA, private tech companies and businesses that house and hold user data will be forced to hand over said data to the Department of Homeland Security if requested. Not only will this lead to the slippery slope of ethics in business with regards to customer's private data, but as future programmers, we face an industry that may very well force us into compliance due to the nature of the law.

          Without reducing this to a political stance, we as programmers should be the first in line to combat this bill and the similar ones that have and will pop up in the future. We aim to enter an industry that is now forced to be in the precarious position of being asked to fork over user's private data to government agencies in the name of anti-terrorism. We, as the builders of code, are the one's responsible for creating the encryption processes in place to hide said private data. You can chalk it up to idealism, but the bottom line is that once this becomes law, companies are going to be forced to comply with it and the people that trust us with their data will have no reason to in the future. Our world is becoming more and more reliant on web based services and the accompanying data encryption that goes along with these services and these bills aim to create a rift between the consumer and the provider.

          While the aim of saving lives and stopping malicious hackers is in and of itself a good sentiment, these bills can be used for just as nefarious purposes on the opposing side. We, as Americans, are dealing with a push back against the "police state" right now, with most of the criticism being that one side holds too much power over the other and is not accountable for their actions. These bills are in the same line as that debate, only they allow our personal information and freedoms to be co-opted without our knowledge and behind closed doors, or firewalls, if you will. On the micro level, once signed into law, as programmers in training, we will most likely be forced to comply with any demands given to us reagarding handing over people's info, regardless of where we feel it falls on the moral compass. On the macro level, the entire industry may lose more and more of the public trust that they have worked so hard to gain in the past, leaving less room for innovation and creativity, and more for distrust and skepticism.
